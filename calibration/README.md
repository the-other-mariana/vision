# Opencv Calibration Sample Code Customization

Now, we will customize OpenCV's [calibration.cpp]() file so that we can adjust to the method and pattern we will use. This file can be found at: `C:\OpenCV-4.2.0\opencv\sources\samples\cpp`, while all the example input images and files are found at: `C:\OpenCV-4.2.0\opencv\sources\samples\data`.
