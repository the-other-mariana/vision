# Phase Shifting

## Stripes

The idea is to project first a series of lines, where their frquency is related as *steps*. The first step is to have one black stripe of width of half the image, the second step would be to have two black stripes, where each of them has the width of the half of the half of the image, and so on.

### Output (10 steps)
